#was seen (Hint: remember that when an undefined value is used as if
#it were a number, Perl automatically converts it to 0. It may help
#to look back at the earlier exercise that kept a running total.) So,
#if the input words were fred, barney, fred, dino, wilma, fred (all on
#separate lines), the output should tell us that fred was seen 3 times.
#For extra credit, sort the summary words in code point order in the output.
